# üîó Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tutorial

A comprehensive tutorial and implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building AI agents that can seamlessly interact with external tools and data sources.

## üéØ Overview

This project contains two main components that work together to demonstrate modern AI agent development:

1. **MCP Tutorial** (`MCP_Tutorial.ipynb`) - A comprehensive guide to building Model Context Protocol (MCP) systems that enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external tools, APIs, and data sources through a standardized protocol.

2. **LangGraph Agent Examples** (`class_10_code.ipynb`) - Practical implementations of LangGraph agents for building AI applications with complex workflows, state management, and multi-step decision making.

### How They Work Together

- **MCP** provides the foundation for tool integration and external data access
- **LangGraph** provides the framework for orchestrating complex AI workflows
- **Combined** they enable powerful AI agents that can access tools, maintain state, and execute sophisticated multi-step processes

The MCP tutorial teaches you how to create modular, interoperable tools, while the LangGraph examples show you how to build intelligent agents that can use those tools in complex workflows.

## ü§î What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that creates a bridge between AI models and the broader digital ecosystem. It enables:

- **Standardized Communication**: Universal protocol for LLM-tool interaction
- **Dynamic Context Updates**: Real-time information during conversations
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add/remove capabilities
- **Interoperability**: Works across different LLM applications

### MCP vs Traditional Function Calls

| Aspect                     | Traditional Function Calls | MCP                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Protocol**         | Custom implementation      | Standardized protocol  |
| **Flexibility**      | Hard-coded functions       | Dynamic tool discovery |
| **Scalability**      | Limited                    | Highly scalable        |
| **Interoperability** | App-specific               | Cross-platform         |
| **Maintenance**      | High overhead              | Low maintenance        |

## üï∏Ô∏è What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends the LangChain ecosystem by providing a framework for creating complex AI workflows with:

- **State Management**: Persistent memory and context across interactions
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordination between multiple AI agents
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Complex decision trees and branching logic
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless connection with external APIs and data sources
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Interactive workflows with human oversight

### LangGraph vs Traditional Chatbots

| Aspect                | Traditional Chatbots | LangGraph Agents      |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Memory**            | Limited context      | Persistent state      |
| **Complexity**        | Linear conversations | Multi-step workflows  |
| **Decision Making**   | Simple responses     | Conditional logic     |
| **Tool Usage**        | Basic integrations   | Advanced orchestration|
| **Scalability**       | Single agent         | Multi-agent systems   |

### Key LangGraph Concepts

- **Nodes**: Individual processing units in the workflow
- **Edges**: Connections that define the flow between nodes
- **State**: Persistent data that flows through the graph
- **Checkpoints**: Save/restore points for long-running workflows
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Integration points for human decision making
