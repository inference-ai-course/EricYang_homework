# Class 7: Comprehensive Alignment Comparison - PPO vs DPO vs GRPO

## üéØ Overview

Welcome to **Class 7: Comprehensive Alignment Comparison**! This educational module provides a hands-on exploration of the three major alignment methods used in modern language model training:

- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** - The classic RLHF approach used by ChatGPT
- **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)** - A simpler, more stable alternative
- **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)** - The cutting-edge method for flexible alignment

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations
- **Hands-on Training**: Actual model training with simplified implementations
- **Preference Annotation**: Build your own preference datasets with Gradio interfaces
- **Method Comparison**: Side-by-side evaluation of all three alignment approaches
- **Educational Focus**: Clear explanations of concepts, formulas, and trade-offs
- **Production Ready**: Scales from educational examples to real-world applications

## üìö What You'll Learn

### Core Concepts

| Method | Description | Key Advantage | Best Use Case |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **PPO** | Classic RLHF with reward model | Proven, fine control | Safety-critical applications |
| **DPO** | Direct preference optimization | Simple, stable | General alignment tasks |
| **GRPO** | Group-based relative optimization | Sample efficient, flexible | Research and complex reasoning |

### Practical Skills

- ‚úÖ **Preference Data Collection**: Build annotation interfaces
- ‚úÖ **Model Training**: Implement all three alignment methods
- ‚úÖ **Evaluation**: Compare method performance across tasks
- ‚úÖ **Production**: Scale from demos to real applications

### Mathematical Understanding

- **PPO Loss**: `L_PPO = min(r_t(Œ∏)A_t, clip(r_t(Œ∏), 1-Œµ, 1+Œµ)A_t)`
- **DPO Loss**: `L_DPO = -log(œÉ(Œ≤ * preference_diff))`
- **GRPO Loss**: Relative advantage with group comparisons

## üîß Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from class7_1 import AlignmentComparisonManager

# Initialize the manager
manager = AlignmentComparisonManager()

# Load preference datasets
datasets_info = manager.load_preference_datasets()

# Setup models for training
model_info = manager.setup_models()

# Run all alignment methods
results = manager.demonstrate_alignment_methods(model_info, datasets)

# Generate comparison report
report = manager.generate_report(results, evaluation_results)
```

### Interactive Annotation

```python
# Create preference annotation interface
annotation_demo = manager.create_annotation_platform()
annotation_demo.launch()  # Opens in browser
```

### Method Comparison

```python
# Create comparison interface
comparison_demo = manager.create_comparison_demo()
comparison_demo.launch()  # Compare all methods side-by-side
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Memory Errors**
```python
# Reduce model size
USE_SMALL_MODELS = True  # Use DistilGPT-2 instead of larger models
```

**Training Failures**
```python
# Check dataset preparation
prepared_datasets = manager._prepare_datasets_for_training(datasets, tokenizer)
```

**Gradio Issues**
```python
# Install Gradio
pip install gradio
# Launch with specific port
demo.launch(server_port=7860)
```
